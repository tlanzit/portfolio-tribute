    <p>The musical innovator, songwriter and singer Prince was born Prince Rogers Nelson on June 5, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minnesota to John Nelson and Mattie Shaw, both of who were musicians and performed in the Prince Rogers Band. Prince was a musical prodigy and taught himself how to play 27 instruments. On his debut album, <i>For You</i>, Prince is said to have played every single instument. In the album's notes, he is listed as the musician behind <q>all vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bass, bass synth, singing bass, Fuzz bass, electric piano, acoustic piano, mini-Moog, poly-Moog, Arp string ensemble, Arp Pro Soloist, Oberheim four-voice, clavinet, drums, syndrums, water drums, slapsticks, bongos, congas, finger cymbals, wind chimes, orchestral bells, woodblocks, brush trap, tree bell, hand claps and finger snaps.</q></p>
    <p>Music was such an integral part of his life that he had two full sized music venues inside of his home in Paisley Park as well as music studios that were fully staffed 24 hours a day. Prince recorded a new fully produced song every day. His music vault contained more than 50 music videos and hundreds of songs that have never been released. Prince is more famous for his <i>Purple Rain</i> album and movie; however, during his 40 year career, Prince created 39 studio albums, four live albums and multiple compilations. Prince wrote hit songs for Pattie Labelle, Sinead O'Connor, Sheila E, The Time, Tevin Campbell, Martika, Tom Jones, The Bangles, Sheena Easton, Chaka Khan, Stevie Nicks, Vanity 6, Madonna, and Alicia Keys.</p>

He was also inducted into the both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In 1984, with the release of the movie and soundtrack <i>Purple Rain</i>, Prince became the first and only recording artist to have a number one movie, number one single and number one album at the same time. To this day, no other recording artist has accomplished this feat. Prince's musical legacy transcends genres and generations and even though he is gone, he lives on through his music.
